# Track Your Learning.
Make your own Learning Log, and keep a list of the topics you are learning about. Whenever you learn something new about a topic, make an entry summarizing what you have learned.<br>


Keeping track of your daily activities is an impossible task when you have so much to do and there is not enough time to think about what is needed to be done. 
The solution to this problem is to introduce something where a person can track his/her activities and also choose freely what to do in his/her freetime. 
This learning log is a web application to do just the right thing. Using this you can perform and track you activities for present and make future plans and time them according to your comfort. Using this app is easy. You just have to login and you are good to go. The best part is your data is never shared with anyone. Your data is only available to you and will remain until you decide to remove it. If you are really want to know how the app works just give it a go.

Just use the command:<br>
`git clone https://github.com/zmwaris1/learning_log.git`<br>
