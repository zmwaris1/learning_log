# Track Your Learning.
Make your own Learning Log, and keep a list of the topics you are learning about. Whenever you learn something new about a topic, make an entry summarizing what you have learned.<br>

## Tools used:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/python/python.png" alt="Python" height="40" style="vertical-align:top; margin:4px"><img src="https://github.com/zmwaris1/logos/blob/main/django-logo-negative.png" alt="Django" height="40" style="vertical-align:top; margin:4px"><img src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/gunicorn/gunicorn-ar21.png" alt="gunicorn" height="40" style="vertical-align:top; margin:4px"><img src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/heroku/heroku-ar21.png" alt="heroku" height="40" style="vertical-align:top; margin:4px"><br/>


The website link is not working as Heroku has disabled it's free service.<br>
But you can still use the app in your local if you want to add something extra to it.<br>
Just use the command:<br>
`git clone https://github.com/zmwaris1/learning_log.git`<br>
and start workiing on it in your local environment.
